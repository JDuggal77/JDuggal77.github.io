      "reviewSummary": [
        "Annabelle starts running one night and just doesn’t stop, turning a desperate impulse into a cross-country run from Seattle to Washington, D.C. As she runs, short flashbacks gradually reveal the school shooting and targeted harassment that shattered her life.",
        "Reviewers describe the book as ‘aching’ and ‘brutal in a quiet way’—it never lingers on graphic details, but the emotional fallout of gun violence, misogyny, and blame is relentless and honest. The narrative structure, with the slow reveal of what happened, keeps readers tense even though they know something terrible is coming. ",
        "Many readers and librarians praise how Caletti threads in social commentary without turning the story into a lecture: Annabelle’s rage at the boy who hurt her, the systemic excuses made for him, and the way the media romanticizes the wrong people all feel uncomfortably real.",
        "Some reviews mention that the story is emotionally exhausting and recommend it when you’re ready for something heavy rather than a casual weekend read, but most still call it one of the most important YA novels about trauma and survivorhood they’ve read."

      "reviewSummary": [
        "Four lifelong friends—Lena, Tibby, Carmen, and Bridget—spend their first summer apart, staying connected through a pair of jeans that miraculously fits them all. Each girl’s storyline explores a different emotional arc: grief, crushes, body image, divorce, and complicated family relationships.",
        "Readers love how distinct the four voices feel; even if you don’t relate to one girl’s story, you usually find a piece of yourself in another. The book balances humor and tear-jerker moments, especially in Carmen’s storyline with her dad and Lena’s relationship with her grandparents.",
        "A lot of reviews call it ‘comfort reading’—light enough to be fun, but still grounded in real emotional stakes—and praise the way it portrays female friendship as the central love story.",

        "The jeans return for another summer as the girls deal with more complicated problems: parental remarriage, intense crushes that don’t look like fairy tales, and what happens when friends grow in different directions.",
        "Readers appreciate that the sequel doesn’t just copy the first book’s plot; the girls feel a little older and the stakes a little higher. There’s more focus on questions like ‘Who am I outside of my family?’ and ‘How do I move on when something big in my life changes?’",
        "Many fans highlight specific arcs—Bridget confronting her past from book one, or Tibby learning to be less self-centered—as some of the most satisfying character growth in the series.",
        "Some reviewers say the tone is slightly soapier and more dramatic than the first book, but for most, that’s part of the fun of following characters over multiple summers."

        "Readers say this book hits especially hard if you’re reading around your own senior year—it leans into anxiety about leaving home, drifting from friends, and not knowing exactly who you’ll be next.",
        "There’s more explicit discussion of sex and long-term relationships than in the earlier books, which some readers appreciate as realistic progression and others feel shifts the tone a bit.",

        "Reviewers praise Della’s voice as sharp, funny, and completely unfiltered; she uses euphemisms like ‘the bad stuff’ and ‘trouble words’ to talk about things she can’t fully name yet, which makes the book accessible without minimizing the reality of sexual abuse.",
        "Educators and librarians highlight how carefully the story balances content: it’s clear what has happened and how wrong it was, but nothing is described in graphic detail. The focus is on coping mechanisms, therapy, found family, and learning that what happened was not the girls’ fault.",
        "Many adult readers say it’s a hard but essential read and stress the importance of the content warnings; for some, the emotional honesty is almost too close to home, but the consensus is that it offers a powerful model of survival, solidarity, and speaking up."
      ],
      "themes": ["child sexual abuse", "foster care", "sisterhood", "healing", "found family"],

      "reviewSummary": [
        "After a car accident kills her younger sister, Rumi is sent from the mainland U.S. to live with an aunt in Hawaii while her mother shuts down emotionally. The book follows Rumi’s slow, stubborn journey through numbness, guilt, and anger as she relearns how to care about anything—including music. ",
        "Reviewers repeatedly mention that this is not a fast or flashy book; it’s character-driven and very internal, with lots of scenes of quiet conversations, ocean imagery, and Rumi processing feelings she doesn’t want to have. For many readers, that slowness feels realistic to grief and is part of the appeal.",
        "The setting is another big draw—Hawaii is not treated as just a tourist backdrop, and readers love the inclusion of local culture, food, and side characters who challenge Rumi’s assumptions.",
        "Some readers who prefer more plot-driven stories or ‘lighter’ grief books say it felt too slow or emotionally heavy for where they were at the time, but even many of them still describe the writing as beautiful and the portrayal of grief as painfully authentic."

        "Reviewers praise Browne’s lyrical, sparse style; a lot of emotional weight sits in very short poems, and readers say a single line can flip how you understand an entire relationship.",
        "Many Black girl readers in particular highlight how validating it feels to see experiences with colorism, body shaming, and social hierarchy expressed so directly and poetically.",
        "Some readers unused to novels in verse say it took a while to get into the rhythm or they wished for more conventional plot beats, but even those often comment on specific lines or images that stayed with them long after."

        "Readers emphasize that this is a quiet story about piecing yourself back together rather than a dramatic thriller about the abuse itself. Browne uses fragmented vignettes, poetry, and prose to mirror Angel’s internal state.",
        "Many educators like how the book weaves in references to other Black authors and books Angel discovers, turning the novel into a sort of mini-reading list of Black literature and poetry.",
        "Some readers found the narrative slightly disjointed, but fans argue that the fragmentary style fits a character still processing trauma and learning to trust again."

        "Fans of Browne’s earlier work say this continues her pattern of centering Black girls’ emotional lives with nuance, letting them be messy, scared, and hopeful all at once.",
