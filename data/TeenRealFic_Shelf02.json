      "reviewSummary": [
        "The story follows three biological siblings—Grace, Maya, and Joaquin—who were separated at birth and reunite as teens, each carrying emotional wounds connected to adoption, foster care, and belonging. Readers frequently praise the emotional honesty of the writing, noting how each sibling wrestles with different kinds of abandonment and the fear of letting themselves be loved. Reviewers often highlight how Benway captures that messy middle ground of healing—there’s rarely a neat breakthrough, just small, tentative steps toward trust.",

Another thing reviewers emphasize is how believable the sibling bond feels, starting with awkwardness and slowly turning into fierce loyalty. The pacing is gentle, giving scenes room to breathe, and many say this allows the emotional depth to land harder.",
